# Tiny Matching Engine

This repository contains the implementation of a Matching Engine, designed as part of the Software Engineering 1 course at the University of Tehran, Spring 2024. The Matching Engine facilitates the processing of buy and sell orders in a stock exchange market.

## New Features Implemented

This project builds upon the TinyME Matching Engine with several new features implemented. The enhancements include:

- **Minimum Execution Quantity (MEQ)**
  - Implemented MEQ functionality to ensure orders meet minimum quantity requirements upon entry.

- **Stop Limit Order**
  - Added support for Stop Limit Orders, which activate when the last traded price reaches a specified stop price.

- **Paying Technical Debt**
  - Addressed technical debt accumulated in the previous phases to enhance overall system performance and maintainability.

- **Auction Matching**
  - Introduced Auction Matching, allowing orders to be placed directly into the order book without immediate matching, suitable for specific market conditions.

- **Refactoring**
  - Conducted refactoring to improve code structure and readability, aligning with best practices in software design.
